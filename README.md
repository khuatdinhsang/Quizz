Tech Stack
Here's a list of packages that you should be at least familiar with before starting your project. However, the best way to see a complete list of the dependencies is to check package.json file.

Getting Started
- use Yarn to manage your packages (npm install -g yarn)

- Create file .env and copy .env.dev.example to .env

- install all dependencies (run terminal "yarn")

- Then, run the development server: "yarn start"



Open http://localhost:7900 (if not auto open in new tabs) with your browser to see the result.
Happy coding!
